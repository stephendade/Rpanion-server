# Rpanion-server

This is a node.js based server for companion computers used in Mavlink-based vehicles (ie Ardupilot, PX4).

It presents a web-based interface (running on the companion computer), where system settings such as network,
telemetry and video streaming can be configured from.

## Features

Rpanion-server allows the user to configure:

- Flight Controller telemetry routing to udp outputs
- Video Streaming via an RTSP server
- Network configuration

## Dependencies and First-time configuration

### Automatic (Raspberry Pi)

Run the ``./deploy/RasPi-deploy.sh`` on a fresh Raspian install to configure and install Rpanion-server. Note
this does not configure an initial Wifi hotspot.

This can be done directly by typing the following into a Raspian console:

```
curl -sL https://github.com/stephendade/Rpanion-server/raw/master/deploy/RasPi-deploy.sh | bash -
```

For an initial Wifi hotspot, run the ``./deploy/wifi_access_point.sh`` script. The hotspot has the SSID "rpanion"
and password "rpanion123". The Pi's IP address will be 10.0.2.100, so the Rpanion-sever website will be available
at http://10.0.2.100:3000

### Manual

Rpanion-server requires Version 12 of node.js or later, It can be installed
via package manager:

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs npm
```

The required prerequisite packages can be installed via:

```
sudo apt install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0* libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-plugins-base-apps network-manager python3 python3-dev python3-gst-1.0 python3-pip dnsmasq

sudo apt purge openresolv dhcpcd5

pip3 install netifaces --user
```

For some systems (such as the Raspberry Pi), additional permissions may be requires to run ``nmcli`` from the
default user. In ``/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf`` add ``auth-polkit=false`` in the ``main`` section.

The node.js packages need to be installed using ``npm install`` in the Rpanion-server folder.

If running in production (ie non-development) mode, run ``npm run build`` to build the React frontend. This gives
performance increases over running in development mode.

## Building and Running

If the Raspberry Pi Camera is intended to be used, the specific Gstreamer element (credit to 
https://github.com/thaytan/gst-rpicamsrc) must be installed:

```
git submodule init && git submodule update
cd ./modules/gst-rpicamsrc
./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/
make
sudo make install
```

Rpanion-server consists of a node.js server running on port 3001 and a React frontend application
running on port 3000 in development mode. 

In production mode, the React application is rendered statically
from the node.js server on port 3001. This can be overidden via setting the ``PORT`` environment
variable (see ``rpanion.service`` for for example).

You can start the server on its own with the command:

```bash
npm run server
```

Run the React application on its own with the command:

```bash
npm start
```

Run both applications together with the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build and run the application in production mode:
```bash
npm run build
PORT=3000
npm run server
```

At this point, the website will be active at ``http://<ip of device>:3000``

Unit tests can be run with the command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Running as a Service

To have Rpanion-server running on automatically on boot, there is an included systemd service file.

This can be enabled via:

```
sudo cp rpanion.service /etc/systemd/system
sudo systemctl enable rpanion.service
```
